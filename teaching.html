        The complex spatio-temporal relationships between the environment and health/health disparities remain an interdisciplinary research challenge. 
        In the summer of 2022, I was the lead instructor for a summer internship with the University of New Mexico Department of Geography & Environmental Studies, in collaboration with Diné College, 
        National Science Foundation (NSF) funded TickBase Team, UNM METALS Superfund Research Program Center and Native Environmental Health Equity Research Center, 
        that provided training on GIS and Geospatial Data Science addressing environmental health issues, which included: (1) introduction to GIS for managing, integrating, 
        analyzing, and visualizing geospatial data and information; (2) geospatial analysis and modeling concepts, methods, and applications in environmental health; (3) performing GIS and 
        geospatial analysis using GIS software; (4) topics on the intersection of  GIS & geospatial spatial analysis and environmental health; and (5) developing projects for real-world problem solving. 
        Students were introduced to existing ongoing environmental health projects at UNM.

    <p class="p-just">
        As part of my assistantship at the <a href="https://yanlingeo.wordpress.com/health-environmental-research-gis-lab/" target="_blank">Health and Environmental Research (HER) GIS Lab</a> I mentor undergraduate student interns as part of a program between our lab and Bunker Hill Community College. 
        I help these students develope their skills in an active research setting.
